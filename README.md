## GwonHeeJun @GwonHeeJun

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am a junior front-end developer, who working at mobility start-up, The swing.

Gwangju Software Meister High School participated in the dormitory management page and outsourced staff to carry out various projects.

I'm developing my skills as a Front-end job.

We are developing web pages using React and hybrid apps using React Native.

We are working on some projects by ourselves, from planning to developing to distributing them.

We are not only working on the front-end, but also working on the back-end and design line to develop understanding of various job groups.

I was able to understand the UI components that can be recycled while collaborating on the design part in some projects.

Also, I learned the importance of communicating with other job groups while receiving orders from various companies.

Meet regularly and communicate with each other on a project.

It also builds the ability to utilize collaboration tools such as slacks and knots and applies them to various projects.

Almost all projects are managed and in progress using the GitHub.
